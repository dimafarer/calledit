in  **@make_call.py**  we use aws Nova to take a prediction made in natural language and convert it to a josn object that can be saved in ddb and later varified by another llm agent (preferabley) or a human being. I want to modify the prompt by first making a calll to datetime to get todays datea and time. To save that as a attribute and to prompt the llm model to use the datetaime to crerate a varification date for the prediction. The current version has the LLM makea varification date field but does not supply the current date which inhibits the model from giving as good as a response as it cold

---

I'll help you modify the `make_call.py` file to include the current date and time in the prompt to the LLM model. This will help the model provide a better verification date for the prediction.

Let's first examine the current code and then make the necessary changes:

---



Now I'll modify the code to include the current date and time in the prompt to the LLM model:

---

Adding code to get the current date and time and include it in the prompt to the LLM model to help it provide a better verification date.

---

Adding the creation_date field to the sanitized response to store when the prediction was made.

---



I've made the following changes to the `make_call.py` file:

1. Added code to get the current date and time:
   - Used `datetime.now()` to get the current date and time
   - Created two formatted strings:
     - `formatted_date`: Just the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
     - `formatted_datetime`: Full date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format

2. Enhanced the prompt to the LLM model:
   - Added the current date and time information to the prompt
   - Added guidance for the model to use a realistic future date based on the prediction and today's date

3. Added a new field to the response:
   - Included `creation_date` in the sanitized response to store when the prediction was made

These changes will help the LLM model provide more accurate verification dates by giving it context about the current date. The model can now make better decisions about when a prediction should be verified based on the nature of the prediction and the current date.

The `creation_date` field in the response will also be useful for tracking when predictions were made, which could be valuable for analysis or auditing purposes.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the implementation?

---

to print out ___str__ use the folowwing code \n\n class Plant():
    plant_count = 0
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Plant.plant_count += 1
        # print('Plant created')
        # name = 'GroovyPlant'
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
    
    def __str__(self):
        print(f'The pant class has {Plant.plant_count} instances')

---

I'll help you fix the `__str__` method in the Plant class. The current implementation has a few issues:

1. `__str__` should return a string, not print it
2. There's a typo in the word "plant" in the message
3. The last print statement has an error with `Plant.to`

Let me fix these issues:

---

Fixing the Plant class implementation with correct __str__ method and fixing the print statements

---



Key changes made:
1. Changed `__str__` to use `return` instead of `print`
2. Fixed the typo in "plant"
3. Fixed the print statements at the bottom to properly demonstrate the `__str__` method
4. Removed the invalid `Plant.to` reference

Now when you run this code, it will:
1. Create two Plant instances
2. Print the name of plant1 using get_name()
3. Print the string representation of plant1 using the __str__ method
4. Print "end of file"

Try running the code and you should see proper output showing the plant count when printing a Plant instance.

---

in @strands_make_call.py  both the user prompt and the system prompt have response instructions. Is this best practice or should all response instructions be in one place?

---

Looking at your code, I notice that you have response format instructions in both the system prompt and the user prompt:

1. In the system prompt:
```python
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Always format your response as a valid JSON object with:
- prediction_statement: A clear restatement of the prediction
- verification_date: A future date when this prediction can be verified
- verification_method: An object containing:
  - source: List of sources to check for verification
  - criteria: List of specific criteria to determine if prediction is true
  - steps: List of steps to follow to verify the prediction
- initial_status: Always set to "pending"

Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
```

2. In the user prompt:
```python
REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
- prediction_statement: Clear restatement of the prediction
- verification_date: Realistic future date and or time when this can be verified (in UTC)
- verification_method: 
  - source: List of reliable sources to check
  - criteria: Specific measurable criteria
  - steps: Verification process steps
- initial_status: "pending"
```

This is generally not considered best practice. Having formatting instructions in both places can be redundant and potentially confusing for the model if there are any inconsistencies.

Best practices suggest:

1. Put format instructions in the system prompt when they represent permanent requirements that won't change between calls
2. Put specific details or contextual information in the user prompt

For your code, I'd recommend consolidating the format instructions in the system prompt and using the user prompt only for the specific prediction and contextual information like dates and timezones.

Here's how you could modify your code:

---

pleae give me a code suggestion for consolidating the output instuctions

---

I'll provide a code suggestion to consolidate the output instructions in your `strands_make_call.py` file:

---

Consolidating output format instructions in the system prompt and removing redundant instructions from the user prompt

---

I've consolidated the output format instructions by:

1. Removing the redundant "REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE" section from the user prompt
2. Keeping all formatting instructions in the system prompt where they belong
3. Enhancing the system prompt instructions slightly for clarity:
   - Added "realistic" to the verification_date description
   - Specified "(in UTC)" for the date format
   - Added "detailed" to the steps description

The user prompt now only contains:
- The prediction to analyze
- Contextual information (today's date, current time, user timezone)

This approach follows best practices for LLM prompting by:
1. Keeping permanent instructions in the system prompt
2. Keeping the user prompt focused on the specific task and context
3. Avoiding redundancy that could confuse the model
4. Maintaining a clear separation of concerns between system and user roles

This change should make your code more maintainable and potentially improve the consistency of your model's responses.

i'm having trouble resetting my venv. its been deactivated but its still showing up in my prompt. Q helped me write a function in bashrc to reset the prompt, but it did not work. I want a clean env so I can turn on my virtual env properly \n\n (venv) wsluser$ python --version
Command 'python' not found, did you mean:
  command 'python3' from deb python3
  command 'python' from deb python-is-python3
(venv) wsluser$ deactivate
deactivate: command not found
(venv) wsluser$ force_deactivate
PS!=\\u\\$ : command not found
Virtual environment forcefully deactivated
(venv) wsluser$

---

I see you're having trouble with your virtual environment. The issue is that the virtual environment indicator "(venv)" is still showing in your prompt even though the environment itself seems to be deactivated (since Python commands aren't working).

Let's fix this by adding a proper function to your `.bashrc` file:

---

Adding a proper reset_venv function to the user's .bashrc file

---

no tht is not quit right. There is already a function in .bashrc to do that, but its not working properly. Please fix the existing function or delete and make a new one

---

Let me help you fix your virtual environment issue. First, let's check your existing function in `.bashrc` and then fix it.

---

Checking the existing venv reset function in .bashrc

---

I found the issue! Your existing `force_deactivate` function has a typo in the PS1 assignment. It's using `PS!` instead of `PS1`. Let me fix that:

---

Fixing the force_deactivate function in .bashrc

---

Creating a temporary script to fix the prompt immediately

---

I found the issue in your existing `force_deactivate` function! There was a typo in the prompt setting line:

```bash
PS!='\\u\\$ '  # This should be PS1, not PS!
```

I've made two fixes:

1. Fixed the typo in your existing `force_deactivate` function by changing `PS!=` to `PS1=`

2. Added a new improved `reset_venv` function to your `.bashrc` that:
   - Unsets the VIRTUAL_ENV variable
   - Properly resets your PS1 prompt
   - Cleans up your PATH

Additionally, I created a temporary script that you can use immediately to fix your prompt without having to log out and back in:

To fix your prompt right now, run:

```bash
source ~/fix_prompt.sh
```

After that, your prompt should be clean (without the "(venv)" prefix), and you can create and activate a new virtual environment normally.

For future use, you can either:
- Use the fixed `force_deactivate` function
- Use the new `reset_venv` function (which has a more complete implementation)

Both functions will be available after you open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

---

yikes the propt is too long I only want it to say the current dir nott the whole path and the user name

---

I understand you want a simpler prompt that only shows the current directory name rather than the full path and username. Let me fix that for you:

---

Fixing the prompt in both functions to only show current directory

---

Creating a new fix_prompt script with the minimal prompt

---

I've updated both your `.bashrc` functions and the temporary fix script to use a minimal prompt that only shows the current directory name followed by a dollar sign.

The new prompt format will be: `directoryname $ `

To apply this change immediately:

```bash
source ~/fix_prompt.sh
```

This will:
1. Remove the "(venv)" prefix
2. Set your prompt to only show the current directory name
3. Clean up your PATH

The same minimal prompt format has also been applied to both the `force_deactivate` and `reset_venv` functions in your `.bashrc` file.

After running the fix script, your prompt should be much cleaner and simpler, showing only what you need.

---

lets talk app refactoring and design check out  **@README.md** and then i&#39;ll tell you what I want to do next

---



I've reviewed the README.md file for your CalledIt application, which is a serverless prediction verification platform built on AWS. It uses AWS Cognito for authentication, Lambda for serverless compute, DynamoDB for data storage, and Amazon Bedrock for AI-powered verification method generation.

Based on the README and the MCP tools notebook you're showing me, I understand you're interested in discussing app refactoring and design. What specifically would you like to do next with your application? Are you considering integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools into your existing architecture, or do you have other refactoring goals in mind?

Some potential areas for discussion could be:

1. Integrating MCP tools with your existing Bedrock implementation
2. Refactoring your prediction verification system
3. Improving the architecture of your backend services
4. Enhancing the frontend user experience

Let me know what direction you'd like to explore, and I can provide more targeted guidance.

I want to stream the lambda response back to the react app so the user sees starts to see feedback while they wait for the complete response. currently when yu make a prediciton/call there is a lot of waiting for the response. I see 2 possoible ways to stream the ffedbacl, i&#39;m goint to past in the strands sdk pages for both. lets then talk options. \n\n https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/streaming/async-iterators/ \n\n Async Iterators for Streaming¶
Strands Agents SDK provides support for asynchronous iterators through the stream_async method, enabling real-time streaming of agent responses in asynchronous environments like web servers, APIs, and other async applications.

Note: If you want to use callbacks instead of async iterators, take a look at the callback handlers documentation. Async iterators are ideal for asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI, aiohttp, or Django Channels. For these environments, Strands Agents SDK offers the stream_async method which returns an asynchronous iterator.

Basic Usage¶

import asyncio
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

# Initialize our agent without a callback handler
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=None
)

# Async function that iterators over streamed agent events
async def process_streaming_response():
    agent_stream = agent.stream_async(&quot;Calculate 2+2&quot;)
    async for event in agent_stream:
        print(event)

# Run the agent
asyncio.run(process_streaming_response())
Event Types¶
The async iterator yields the same event types as callback handlers, including:

Text Generation Events¶
data: Text chunk from the model&#39;s output
complete: Boolean indicating if this is the final chunk
delta: Raw delta content from the model
Tool Events¶
current_tool_use: Information about the current tool being used, including:
toolUseId: Unique ID for this tool use
name: Name of the tool
input: Tool input parameters (accumulated as streaming occurs)
Lifecycle Events¶
init_event_loop: True when the event loop is initializing
start_event_loop: True when the event loop is starting
start: True when a new cycle starts
message: Present when a new message is created
event: Raw event from the model stream
force_stop: True if the event loop was forced to stop
force_stop_reason: Reason for forced stop
Reasoning Events¶
reasoning: True for reasoning events
reasoningText: Text from reasoning process
reasoning_signature: Signature from reasoning process
FastAPI Example¶
Here&#39;s how to integrate stream_async with FastAPI to create a streaming endpoint:


from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
from pydantic import BaseModel
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator, http_request

app = FastAPI()

class PromptRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

 **@app.post(&quot;/stream&quot;)**
async def stream_response(request: PromptRequest):
    async def generate():
        agent = Agent(
            tools=[calculator, http_request],
            callback_handler=None
        )

        try:
            async for event in agent.stream_async(request.prompt):
                if &quot;data&quot; in event:
                    # Only stream text chunks to the client
                    yield event[&quot;data&quot;]
        except Exception as e:
            yield f&quot;Error: {str(e)}&quot;

    return StreamingResponse(
        generate(),
        media_type=&quot;text/plain&quot;
    )  \n\n https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/streaming/callback-handlers/  \n\n  Callback Handlers¶
Callback handlers are a powerful feature of the Strands Agents SDK that allow you to intercept and process events as they happen during agent execution. This enables real-time monitoring, custom output formatting, and integration with external systems.

Callback handlers receive events in real-time as they occur during an agent&#39;s lifecycle:

Text generation from the model
Tool selection and execution
Reasoning process
Errors and completions
Note: For asynchronous applications such as web servers, Strands Agents also provides async iterators as an alternative to callback-based callback handlers.

Basic Usage¶
The simplest way to use a callback handler is to pass a callback function to your agent:


from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def custom_callback_handler(**kwargs):
    # Process stream data
    if &quot;data&quot; in kwargs:
        print(f&quot;MODEL OUTPUT: {kwargs[&#39;data&#39;]}&quot;)
    elif &quot;current_tool_use&quot; in kwargs and kwargs[&quot;current_tool_use&quot;].get(&quot;name&quot;):
        print(f&quot;\nUSING TOOL: {kwargs[&#39;current_tool_use&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]}&quot;)

# Create an agent with custom callback handler
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=custom_callback_handler
)

agent(&quot;Calculate 2+2&quot;)
Callback Handler Events¶
Callback handlers receive the same event types as async iterators, as keyword arguments:

Text Generation Events¶
data: Text chunk from the model&#39;s output
complete: Boolean indicating if this is the final chunk
delta: Raw delta content from the model
Tool Events¶
current_tool_use: Information about the current tool being used, including:
toolUseId: Unique ID for this tool use
name: Name of the tool
input: Tool input parameters (accumulated as streaming occurs)
Lifecycle Events¶
init_event_loop: True when the event loop is initializing
start_event_loop: True when the event loop is starting
start: True when a new cycle starts
message: Present when a new message is created
event: Raw event from the model stream
force_stop: True if the event loop was forced to stop
force_stop_reason: Reason for forced stop
Reasoning Events¶
reasoning: True for reasoning events
reasoningText: Text from reasoning process
reasoning_signature: Signature from reasoning process
Default Callback Handler¶
Strands Agents provides a default callback handler that formats output to the console:


from strands import Agent
from strands.handlers.callback_handler import PrintingCallbackHandler

# The default callback handler prints text and shows tool usage
agent = Agent(callback_handler=PrintingCallbackHandler())
If you want to disable all output, specify None for the callback handler:


from strands import Agent

# No output will be displayed
agent = Agent(callback_handler=None)
Custom Callback Handlers¶
Custom callback handlers enable you to have fine-grained control over what is streamed from your agents.

Example - Print all events in the stream sequence¶
Custom callback handlers can be useful to debug sequences of events in the agent loop:


from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def debugger_callback_handler(**kwargs):
    # Print the values in kwargs so that we can see everything
    print(kwargs)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=debugger_callback_handler
)

agent(&quot;What is 922 + 5321&quot;)
This handler prints all calls to the callback handler including full event details.

Example - Buffering Output Per Message¶
This handler demonstrates how to buffer text and only show it when a complete message is generated. This pattern is useful for chat interfaces where you want to show polished, complete responses:


import json
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def message_buffer_handler(**kwargs):
    # When a new message is created from the assistant, print its content
    if &quot;message&quot; in kwargs and kwargs[&quot;message&quot;].get(&quot;role&quot;) == &quot;assistant&quot;:
        print(json.dumps(kwargs[&quot;message&quot;], indent=2))

# Usage with an agent
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=message_buffer_handler
)

agent(&quot;What is 2+2 and tell me about AWS Lambda&quot;)
This handler leverages the message event which is triggered when a complete message is created. By using this approach, we can buffer the incrementally streamed text and only display complete, coherent messages rather than partial fragments. This is particularly useful in conversational interfaces or when responses benefit from being processed as complete units.

Example - Event Loop Lifecycle Tracking¶
This callback handler illustrates the event loop lifecycle events and how they relate to each other. It&#39;s useful for understanding the flow of execution in the Strands agent:


from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def event_loop_tracker(**kwargs):
    # Track event loop lifecycle
    if kwargs.get(&quot;init_event_loop&quot;, False):
        print(&quot;🔄 Event loop initialized&quot;)
    elif kwargs.get(&quot;start_event_loop&quot;, False):
        print(&quot;▶️ Event loop cycle starting&quot;)
    elif kwargs.get(&quot;start&quot;, False):
        print(&quot;📝 New cycle started&quot;)
    elif &quot;message&quot; in kwargs:
        print(f&quot;📬 New message created: {kwargs[&#39;message&#39;][&#39;role&#39;]}&quot;)
    elif kwargs.get(&quot;complete&quot;, False):
        print(&quot;✅ Cycle completed&quot;)
    elif kwargs.get(&quot;force_stop&quot;, False):
        print(f&quot;🛑 Event loop force-stopped: {kwargs.get(&#39;force_stop_reason&#39;, &#39;unknown reason&#39;)}&quot;)

    # Track tool usage
    if &quot;current_tool_use&quot; in kwargs and kwargs[&quot;current_tool_use&quot;].get(&quot;name&quot;):
        tool_name = kwargs[&quot;current_tool_use&quot;][&quot;name&quot;]
        print(f&quot;🔧 Using tool: {tool_name}&quot;)

    # Show only a snippet of text to keep output clean
    if &quot;data&quot; in kwargs:
        # Only show first 20 chars of each chunk for demo purposes
        data_snippet = kwargs[&quot;data&quot;][:20] + (&quot;...&quot; if len(kwargs[&quot;data&quot;]) &gt; 20 else &quot;&quot;)
        print(f&quot;📟 Text: {data_snippet}&quot;)

# Create agent with event loop tracker
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=event_loop_tracker
)

# This will show the full event lifecycle in the console
agent(&quot;What is the capital of France and what is 42+7?&quot;)
The output will show the sequence of events:

First the event loop initializes (init_event_loop)
Then the cycle begins (start_event_loop)
New cycles may start multiple times during execution (start)
Text generation and tool usage events occur during the cycle
Finally, the cycle completes (complete) or may be force-stopped
Best Practices¶
When implementing callback handlers:

Keep Them Fast: Callback handlers run in the critical path of agent execution
Handle All Event Types: Be prepared for different event types
Graceful Errors: Handle exceptions within your handler
State Management: Store accumulated state in the request_state

Based on your requirements, you want to implement streaming responses from your Lambda function to your React frontend to provide real-time feedback while users wait for the complete prediction response. Let me analyze the two approaches you've shared from the Strands SDK documentation.

## Approach Comparison

### 1. Async Iterators
- **Pros**: Clean async/await pattern, works well with async frameworks
- **Cons**: Requires more backend infrastructure changes, needs API Gateway with HTTP/2 support

### 2. Callback Handlers
- **Pros**: Simpler to implement, works with existing Lambda structure
- **Cons**: May require more state management

## Implementation Recommendation

For your serverless architecture, I recommend using **API Gateway WebSockets** with the callback handler approach. This is the most straightforward way to implement streaming in a serverless environment.

Here's a minimal implementation plan:

### 1. Backend Changes

```python
# backend/calledit-backend/handlers/make_call/make_call_stream.py
import json
import boto3
import os
from datetime import datetime
from strands import Agent

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract connection ID for WebSocket
    connection_id = event.get('requestContext', {}).get('connectionId')
    api_gateway_management_api = boto3.client(
        'apigatewaymanagementapi',
        endpoint_url=f"https://{event['requestContext']['domainName']}/{event['requestContext']['stage']}"
    )
    
    # Get the prompt from the event body
    body = json.loads(event.get('body', '{}'))
    prompt = body.get('prompt', '')
    
    # Get current date and time
    current_datetime = datetime.now()
    formatted_date = current_datetime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    formatted_datetime = current_datetime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    # Define callback handler for streaming
    def stream_callback_handler(**kwargs):
        if "data" in kwargs:
            # Send text chunks to the client
            try:
                api_gateway_management_api.post_to_connection(
                    ConnectionId=connection_id,
                    Data=json.dumps({
                        "type": "text",
                        "content": kwargs["data"]
                    })
                )
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error sending to WebSocket: {str(e)}")
        elif "current_tool_use" in kwargs and kwargs["current_tool_use"].get("name"):
            # Send tool usage info
            try:
                api_gateway_management_api.post_to_connection(
                    ConnectionId=connection_id,
                    Data=json.dumps({
                        "type": "tool",
                        "name": kwargs["current_tool_use"]["name"]
                    })
                )
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error sending to WebSocket: {str(e)}")

        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in lambda_handler: {str(e)}")
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }
```

### 2. SAM Template Update

Add this to your template.yaml:

```yaml

    Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api
    Properties:
      Name: CalledItWebSocketAPI
      ProtocolType: WEBSOCKET

### 3. Frontend React Implementation

```jsx
// frontend/src/components/PredictionForm.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const PredictionForm = () => {
  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState('');
  const [streamingText, setStreamingText] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [prediction, setPrediction] = useState(null);
  const socketRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      // Clean up WebSocket connection when component unmounts
      if (socketRef.current) {
        socketRef.current.close();
      }
    };
  }, []);
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsLoading(true);
    setStreamingText('');
    
    // Create WebSocket connection
    const wsUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL;
    socketRef.current = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
    
    socketRef.current.onopen = () => {
      // Send the prediction request
      socketRef.current.send(JSON.stringify({
        action: 'makecall',
        prompt: prompt
      }));
    };
    
    socketRef.current.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      if (data.type === 'text') {
        setStreamingText(prev => prev + data.content);
      } else if (data.type === 'tool') {
        setStreamingText(prev => prev + `\n[Using tool: ${data.name}]\n`);
      } else if (data.type === 'complete') {
        // Final response received
        setPrediction(JSON.parse(data.content));
        setIsLoading(false);
        socketRef.current.close();
      }
    };
    
    socketRef.current.onerror = (error) => {
      console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
      setIsLoading(false);
    };
    
    socketRef.current.onclose = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
    };
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="prediction-form">
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={prompt}
          onChange={(e) => setPrompt(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter your prediction..."
          rows={4}
          disabled={isLoading}
        />
        <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading || !prompt}>
          {isLoading ? 'Processing...' : 'Make Prediction'}
        </button>
      </form>
      
      {streamingText && (
        <div className="streaming-response">
          <h3>Processing your prediction...</h3>
          <div className="streaming-text">
            {streamingText}
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
      
      {prediction && (
        <div className="prediction-result">
          <h3>Prediction Details</h3>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(prediction, null, 2)}</pre>
          <button onClick={() => {/* Save prediction logic */}}>
            Log Call
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default PredictionForm;
```

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Real-time feedback**: Users see the AI's thought process as it happens
2. **Improved UX**: Reduces perceived waiting time
3. **Scalable**: Works well with serverless architecture
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between streaming and final result handling

This implementation gives you the best of both worlds - streaming responses for better user experience while maintaining your serverless architecture.

lets do it the way you suggested API Gateway WebSockets. But I wanto to do it step by step and make it a learning experience for me. PLease start by righting out the full step by step instructions into 1 or more .md documents. Be verbose explaining what and why we are taking a step is as important as the step itself. After your write the .md file(s) I will imploment them with your help. Ask me any questions you want to, and use as many prompts as you need

---

Creating a comprehensive guide for implementing WebSocket streaming in the CalledIt application

---

Creating a practical step-by-step implementation guide for the WebSocket streaming feature

---



I've created two comprehensive documents to guide you through implementing WebSocket streaming for your CalledIt application:

1. **streaming_implementation_guide.md** - A detailed explanation of the architecture, components, and reasoning behind each implementation decision.

2. **implementation_steps.md** - A practical, step-by-step guide that breaks down the implementation into manageable phases with specific code examples.

These documents cover:

- Setting up WebSocket API Gateway in AWS
- Creating Lambda functions for WebSocket connections
- Implementing streaming with the Strands SDK
- Building a React frontend that handles real-time updates
- Testing and troubleshooting the implementation

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Backend Setup** - Create WebSocket handlers and update your SAM template
2. **Phase 2: Deploy and Test Backend** - Deploy the backend and test with wscat
3. **Phase 3: Frontend Implementation** - Create WebSocket services and components
4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement** - Test the complete solution and refine as needed

Would you like to start implementing this solution? We can begin with any specific part you'd like to focus on first, or I can help you understand any aspect of the implementation in more detail.

---

Switched model to Claude Sonnet 4

---

ok, lets imploment it. which doc should we follow?

---



Let's follow the **implementation_steps.md** document since it's more practical and breaks things down into manageable phases. We'll start with Phase 1: Backend Setup.

Let's begin by creating the WebSocket handler directory and files:



---

Creating the websocket handlers directory structure

---

shell

---



Now let's create the connect handler:

---

Creating the WebSocket connect handler

---



Create the disconnect handler:

---

Creating the WebSocket disconnect handler

---



Now let's create the streaming prediction handler:

---

Creating the streaming Lambda function that handles prediction requests

---



Now let's update the requirements.txt file to include the Strands SDK:

---

Adding strands dependency to the make_call handler requirements

---

Creating requirements.txt for websocket handlers

---



Now let's look at the current SAM template to understand its structure before adding the WebSocket resources:

---



Now I'll add the WebSocket resources to the SAM template. I'll add them at the end of the Resources section:

---

Adding WebSocket API resources to the SAM template

---



Now let's add the WebSocket API endpoint to the outputs section:

---

Adding WebSocket API endpoint to the outputs

---



Now let's build and deploy the backend. First, let's navigate to the backend directory and build:



---

Building the SAM application

---

shell

---



It looks like there's an issue with the Python pip builder. Let's check if we have the strands package available. Let me try a different approach - let's first check if strands is installed in our environment:

---

Checking if strands is installed in the current environment

---

```shell
pip list | grep strands
```

---

i think you ned to activate the venv at venv/bin/activate

---

You stopped your current work, please provide additional examples or ask another question.

---



You're right! Let's activate the virtual environment first:



---

Activating the virtual environment and checking if strands is installed

---

shell

---

Activating the virtual environment and checking if strands is installed

---

shell

---



Great! Strands is installed. Now let's try building the SAM application with the virtual environment activated:



---

Building the SAM application with virtual environment activated

---

shell

---



The build is failing because it can't resolve the strands dependency. Let's try a different approach - let's temporarily remove the strands dependency and build a simpler version first to test the WebSocket infrastructure, then add strands back later.

---

Creating a simple version of the streaming handler without Strands dependency for testing

---



Now let's update the SAM template to use the simple version temporarily:

---

Updating SAM template to use the simple streaming handler

---



Also, let's update the requirements.txt to remove strands temporarily:

---

Temporarily removing strands dependency to test WebSocket infrastructure

---



Now let's try building again:



---

Building the SAM application with the simplified version

---

shell

---



Great! The build succeeded. Now let's deploy it:

---

Deploying the SAM application with WebSocket support

---

```shell
. ../../venv/bin/activate && sam deploy --guided
```

---

did the stack deploy?

---



No, the deployment was cancelled. Let me check if there's an existing stack and then deploy it:



---

Checking if there's an existing CloudFormation stack

---

shell

---



There's an existing stack called `calledit-backend`. Let's deploy to update it:

---

Deploying the updated SAM application to the existing stack

---

```shell
. ../../venv/bin/activate && sam deploy --stack-name calledit-backend
```

---

we need to approve the change set

---

You stopped your current work, please provide additional examples or ask another question.

---



You're right! Let's deploy with the `--no-confirm-changeset` flag to automatically approve the changeset:



---

Deploying the SAM application with auto-approval of changeset

---

shell

---



Excellent! The deployment was successful. I can see the WebSocket API endpoint in the outputs:

**WebSocket API Endpoint**: `wss://0yv5r2auh5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod`

Now let's test the WebSocket API to make sure it's working. Let's install wscat to test it:



---

Installing wscat to test the WebSocket API

---

shell

---



Now let's test the WebSocket connection. Let me create a simple test script:



---

Creating a test script to verify WebSocket functionality

---

Testing the WebSocket API with our test script

---

shell

---



Let's install the ws module:





---

Installing the ws module for WebSocket testing

---

shell

---

Testing the WebSocket API again

---

shell

---



Perfect! The WebSocket API is working correctly. We can see:

1. **Connection established** successfully
2. **Status message** sent initially
3. **Streaming text chunks** sent one by one
4. **Complete response** with the final JSON structure

Now let's move to Phase 3: Frontend Implementation. Let's start by creating the WebSocket service for the React frontend:

---

Creating the services directory in the frontend

---

shell

---

the frontend/src/services directory already created and has other service files in it

---



You're right! Let me check the existing frontend structure first:

---



Perfect! Now let's create the WebSocket service in the existing services directory:

---

Creating the WebSocket service for the React frontend

---



Now let's create the prediction service that uses the WebSocket service:

---

Creating the prediction service that handles streaming predictions

---



Now let's update the services index file to export our new services:

---

Adding the new WebSocket and prediction services to the exports

---



Now let's create a new streaming prediction component. First, let me check if there's an environment configuration file:

---



Let's check the current .env file:

---



Perfect! Let's add the WebSocket URL to the .env file:

---

Adding the WebSocket URL to the environment configuration

---



Now let's create a streaming prediction component:

---

Creating the streaming prediction component for the React frontend

---



Now let's update the App.tsx to include our new streaming component. First, let me check the current App.tsx:

---



Let's add a new view option for streaming predictions. I'll modify the App.tsx to include a third view:

---

Adding import for the StreamingPrediction component

---

Updating NavigationControls to include streaming view option

---

Updating NavigationControls type definitions

---

Updating navigation buttons to include streaming option

---

Updating AppContent state type

---

Updating useEffect to handle streaming view logout

---

Updating navigateTo function type

---

Adding conditional rendering for the streaming component

---



Now let's test the frontend. First, let's start the development server:

---

Starting the frontend development server

---

```shell
npm run dev
```

---

its working but the structured json predictions are weak, overly simple. Are we using /home/wsluser/projects/calledit/backend/calledit-backend/handlers/make_call/make_call_stream_simple.py or /home/wsluser/projects/calledit/backend/calledit-backend/handlers/make_call/make_call_stream.py? in terms of prompting our strand agent the strand lambda had the best system ans user prompts /home/wsluser/projects/calledit/backend/calledit-backend/handlers/strands_make_call/strands_make_call.py

---



You're absolutely right! We're currently using the simple version (`make_call_stream_simple.py`) which just creates a basic mock response. Let's check what we're actually using and then switch to the proper Strands version with better prompting.

---



Perfect! The Strands version has much better prompting. Now let's update our streaming handler to use the proper Strands agent with the good prompts. Let's create a new version that combines the streaming functionality with the better prompting:

---

Creating a new streaming handler that combines WebSocket streaming with the proper Strands agent and prompts

---



Now let's update the requirements.txt to include the necessary dependencies:

---

Adding all necessary dependencies for the Strands streaming handler

---



Now let's update the SAM template to use the new Strands streaming handler:

---

Updating SAM template to use the new Strands streaming handler

---



Now let's build and deploy the updated version:



---

Building the updated SAM application with Strands streaming

---

shell

---



The build is still failing due to the strands dependency issue. Let's try a different approach - let's use the existing strands handler directory which already has the dependencies working:

---



Let's copy our streaming handler to the strands_make_call directory and modify it there:

---

Creating the streaming handler in the strands_make_call directory where dependencies work

---



Now let's update the SAM template to use the strands directory:

---

Updating SAM template to use the strands_make_call directory

---



Now let's build and deploy:



---

Building the SAM application with the proper Strands streaming handler

---

shell

---



Great! The build succeeded. Now let's deploy:



---

Deploying the updated SAM application with proper Strands streaming

---

shell

---



Perfect! The deployment was successful. Now let's test the new streaming functionality with the proper Strands agent. Let's update our test script to test the new version:



---

Creating a test script to verify the new Strands streaming functionality

---

Testing the new Strands streaming WebSocket API

---

shell

---

looks like we need a bedrock inference id for the claude modle

---

You stopped your current work, please provide additional examples or ask another question.

---

You're right! The Strands agent needs access to Bedrock models. Let's update the SAM template to add the necessary Bedrock permissions for the streaming function:

---

Adding comprehensive Bedrock permissions for the streaming function

---

Now let's also check if we need to specify a model ID in the Strands agent. Let me look at how the existing strands_make_call.py handles this:

---

I notice the original strands handler doesn't specify a model ID either, which means Strands uses a default model. Let's deploy the updated permissions first and then test:



---

Building and deploying the updated SAM application with enhanced Bedrock permissions

---

```shell
. ../../venv/bin/activate && sam build && sam deploy --stack-name calledit-backend --no-confirm-changeset

Since we need to verify if the S&P 500 reached 6000 points at any time during March 2025, the verification date should be the last day of March 2025. The current date in the user's timezone (America/New_York) is 2025-06-26, and in UTC is 2025-06-27, which is already past March 2025. This means the prediction's timeframe has already passed and can be verified now. However, to properly structure the verification criteria, I'm setting the verification date as March 31, 2025, which was the end of the specified timeframe."

Excellent! The streaming is working perfectly now! 🎉

## Summary

We have successfully implemented **real-time WebSocket streaming** for your CalledIt prediction verification platform. Here's what we accomplished:

### ✅ **What's Working:**

1. **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Set up API Gateway WebSockets with proper Lambda integrations
2. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time text chunks streaming from the Strands AI agent
3. **Rich Predictions**: Using the proper Strands agent with sophisticated prompting that generates:
   - Detailed prediction statements
   - Realistic verification dates with timezone awareness
   - Comprehensive verification methods (sources, criteria, steps)
   - Date reasoning explanations
4. **Tool Usage Visibility**: Shows when the AI agent uses tools (like `current_time`)
5. **Frontend Integration**: React component ready to display streaming responses

### 🔧 **Key Features:**

- **Real-time streaming**: Users see AI thinking process as it happens
- **Better UX**: No more waiting for complete responses
- **Rich verification data**: Much more detailed than the simple mock version
- **Timezone awareness**: Handles user timezones properly
- **Tool integration**: AI can use tools like date parsing and current time
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages streamed back to client

### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

The streaming functionality is now ready for your frontend! Users will see:
1. Initial processing message
2. Real-time text generation as the AI thinks
3. Tool usage notifications
4. Final structured JSON prediction with comprehensive verification details

The predictions are now much richer and more useful than the simple mock version, providing detailed verification methods that can actually be used to verify predictions later.

Would you like to test this in your React frontend now, or would you like to make any adjustments to the streaming behavior?

ok I think we have reached a good milestone, so I&#39;m going to check the code into git. There are a couple issue I&#39;ll outline next, but first I want to update the two md docs: /home/wsluser/projects/calledit/docs/implementation_steps.md and /home/wsluser/projects/calledit/docs/implementation_steps.md to reflect exctly the steps we ended up taking so far

---

I'll update both documentation files to reflect the exact steps we took to implement the WebSocket streaming functionality.

---

Updating the implementation steps to reflect the actual steps we took

---

Completely rewriting the implementation steps document to reflect the actual steps we took

---

Now let's update the streaming implementation guide to reflect what we actually built:

---

when I&#39;m in the streaming call screen the Log Call button does not work. It is still working as expect in the Make Call screen

---

The issue is that the StreamingPrediction component has a placeholder `handleSavePrediction` function that just logs to console instead of actually calling the API to save the prediction. Let me check the current implementation and fix it.

---

Now let me check how the regular MakePredictions component handles saving predictions:

---

Now let me check the LogCallButton component to see how it saves predictions:

---

Now I understand the issue. The StreamingPrediction component needs to integrate with the existing LogCallButton component and use the same API service. Let me update the StreamingPrediction component to use the LogCallButton:

---

Adding imports for LogCallButton and APIResponse type

---

Adding optional navigation callback prop

---

Adding response state and onNavigateToList prop

---

Converting prediction to APIResponse format for LogCallButton compatibility

---

Replacing placeholder save function with clear function

---

Using the new clear function in handleSubmit

---

Replacing custom button with LogCallButton component

---

Now I need to update the App.tsx to pass the navigation callback to the StreamingPrediction component:

---

Adding navigation callback to StreamingPrediction component

---

Now let's check if we need to import the APIResponse type. Let me check the types file:

---



Perfect! The types are already defined. Now let's test the updated StreamingPrediction component. The Log Call button should now work properly because it's using the same LogCallButton component that works in the regular Make Call screen.

The key changes I made:

1. **Added LogCallButton import and APIResponse type**
2. **Added response state** to store the prediction in the format expected by LogCallButton
3. **Converted the streaming prediction response** to the APIResponse format that LogCallButton expects
4. **Replaced the placeholder save function** with the actual LogCallButton component
5. **Added navigation callback** so users are taken to the list view after successfully logging a call

The StreamingPrediction component now uses the exact same LogCallButton component as the regular MakePredictions component, so it should work identically for saving predictions to the database.

---

that was perfect, please update the documentaton to reflect those updates

---

Adding note about LogCallButton integration

---

Adding section about LogCallButton integration fix

---

Completing the final result list with LogCallButton integration

---

Now let's update the streaming implementation guide:

---

Updating React component example to show LogCallButton integration

---

Adding database integration section

---

Adding detailed issue resolution section at the end

---



Perfect! I've updated both documentation files to reflect the LogCallButton integration fix:

## Updated Documentation

### **implementation_steps.md**
- Added section about LogCallButton integration under "Key Implementation Decisions"
- Documented the issue where Log Call button didn't work in streaming view
- Explained the solution of integrating the existing LogCallButton component
- Updated the final result checklist to include database integration

### **streaming_implementation_guide.md**
- Updated the React component example to show LogCallButton integration
- Added new "Database Integration" section under Key Features
- Added comprehensive "Issue Resolution: LogCallButton Integration" section at the end
- Documented the problem, root cause, solution steps, and result

## Key Points Documented

✅ **Problem Identification:**
- Log Call button worked in Make Call screen but not in Streaming Call screen
- Initial placeholder implementation only logged to console

✅ **Solution Implementation:**
- Integration with existing LogCallButton component
- APIResponse format conversion for compatibility
- Navigation callback for consistent user flow

✅ **Technical Details:**
- Code examples showing the response format conversion
- Complete component integration approach
- Consistent UI behavior across both prediction methods

The documentation now accurately reflects the complete implementation including the LogCallButton integration fix, making it a comprehensive reference for the streaming functionality.

cosmetic update for the streaming call screan: The interface should always use the word &quot;call&quot; instead of &quot;prediction&quot; as the app is named callit. In this context a call and a predition are the same thing. Please also use call instead of prediction when you name things in the code. You will see legacy use of the word prediction in the code. Please work around that if it invovles deep refactoring. Please do update the streaming call ui now

---

Updating UI text from prediction to call terminology

---

Updating streaming text header from prediction to call

---

Updating final result header from prediction to call

---

Updating function name and comment from prediction to call

---

Updating function call from handleNewPrediction to handleNewCall

---

Now let's rename the component file and update the component name to use "call" terminology:

---

Creating new StreamingCall component with call terminology instead of prediction

---

Now let's update the App.tsx to use the new StreamingCall component:

---

Updating import to use new StreamingCall component

---

Updating import to use new StreamingCall component

---

Updating component usage to StreamingCall

---

Now let's create a new service file with call terminology:

---

Creating new CallService with call terminology instead of prediction

---

Now let's update the StreamingCall component to use the new CallService:

---

Updating import to use CallService

---

Updating service reference type

---

Updating service initialization

---

Updating method call to use call terminology

---

Now let's update the services index file to export the new CallService:

---

Adding CallService to exports

---



Perfect! I've updated the streaming interface to use "call" terminology throughout:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **UI Text Updates:**
- "Make a Prediction (Streaming)" → "Make a Call (Streaming)"
- "Your Prediction:" → "Your Call:"
- "Enter your prediction..." → "Enter your call..."
- "Make Prediction" → "Make Call"
- "Processing your prediction..." → "Processing your call..."
- "Prediction Details" → "Call Details"

### 2. **Component Renaming:**
- Created new `StreamingCall.tsx` component (replacing `StreamingPrediction.tsx`)
- Updated component name from `StreamingPrediction` to `StreamingCall`
- Updated props interface from `StreamingPredictionProps` to `StreamingCallProps`

### 3. **Service Layer:**
- Created new `CallService.ts` with call terminology
- Method renamed from `makePredictionWithStreaming` to `makeCallWithStreaming`
- Updated component to use `CallService` instead of `PredictionService`

### 4. **Variable Names:**
- `prediction` state → `call` state
- `handleNewPrediction` → `handleNewCall`
- CSS class `streaming-prediction` → `streaming-call`
- Input ID `prediction-input` → `call-input`

### 5. **App Integration:**
- Updated `App.tsx` to import and use `StreamingCall` component
- Maintained all existing functionality while using consistent "call" terminology

The interface now consistently uses "call" terminology throughout while maintaining all the existing functionality including WebSocket streaming, LogCallButton integration, and navigation. The legacy `PredictionService` is still available for backward compatibility with existing code that hasn't been refactored yet.

UI  update; in the Call Details section of the Make a Call (Streaming) screen its curently displays the raw json. Id like the displate to be formatted like the Make a Call
call details section of  the Make a CAll screan. The &quot;Processing your call...&quot; section of th  Make a Call (Streaming) screen is perfect as its functioning now

---

Let me check how the regular Make Call screen displays the call details and then update the streaming version to match.

---

Perfect! Now I can see how the regular Make Call screen formats the call details. Let me update the StreamingCall component to use the same formatted display instead of raw JSON.

---

Replacing raw JSON display with formatted call details matching the regular Make Call screen

---



Perfect! I've updated the StreamingCall component to display the call details in the same formatted structure as the regular Make Call screen. The changes include:

## Updated Call Details Display:

### **Before:** Raw JSON display
```json
{
  "prediction_statement": "...",
  "verification_date": "...",
  ...
}
```

### **After:** Formatted display matching Make Call screen
- **Call Statement:** Displays the prediction statement clearly
- **Call Date:** Shows the prediction/creation date in readable format
- **Verification Date:** Converts UTC date to local time format
- **Verification Method:** Structured display with:
  - **Sources:** Bulleted list of verification sources
  - **Criteria:** Bulleted list of verification criteria  
  - **Steps:** Bulleted list of verification steps
- **Initial Status:** Shows the current status

The formatting now uses the same CSS classes (`structured-response`, `response-field`, `verification-method`, `method-section`) as the regular Make Call screen, ensuring visual consistency across both interfaces.

The "Processing your call..." streaming section remains unchanged as requested - it continues to show the real-time AI processing with the monospace font and scrollable text area.
