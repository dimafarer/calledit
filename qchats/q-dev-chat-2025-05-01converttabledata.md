I'll help you create a Python script that converts the old format to the new format using the AWS DynamoDB boto3 client. Here's a script that will handle this migration: [[1]](https://repost.aws/questions/QU6YScKHATREeiO-qyzUd5_g/convert-epoch-time-to-human-readable-time-in-dynamodb)

```python

        return False

    # Extract timestamp and userId from the old PK
    old_pk = old_item['PK']['S']

    timestamp = old_pk.split(':')[3]

    new_item = {

        'createdAt': {'S': timestamp},

                    # Put new item
                    dynamodb.put_item(

                    )
                    
                    # Add small delay to avoid exceeding throughput
                    time.sleep(0.1)
            
            if items_processed % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Processed {items_processed} items...")

    print(f"\nMigration Summary:")
    print(f"Total items processed: {items_processed}")
    print(f"Items requiring update: {items_to_update}")
    print(f"Dry run: {dry_run}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TABLE_NAME = os.environ.get('DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME')
    
    if not TABLE_NAME:
        raise ValueError("DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME environment variable must be set")

    # First do a dry run to see how many items would be affected
    print("Performing dry run...")
    migrate_table(TABLE_NAME, dry_run=True)
    
    # Ask for confirmation before actual migration
    response = input("\nDo you want to proceed with the actual migration? (yes/no): ")

        print("Migration completed!")
    else:
        print("\nMigration cancelled.")
```

This script:

1. Includes a function to detect if an item is in the old format by checking for ":Call:" in the PK
2. Converts old format items to the new format by:
   - Restructuring the PK and SK
   - Adding createdAt and updatedAt timestamps
   - Converting status to uppercase
   - Preserving all other fields
3. Uses pagination to handle large tables
4. Includes a dry run mode to safely check how many items would be affected
5. Implements error handling and progress reporting
6. Uses environment variables for the table name
7. Includes a confirmation step before actual migration

To use the script:

1. Set the environment variable:
```bash
export DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME='your-table-name'
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python migration_script.py
```

The script will first perform a dry run to show you how many items would be affected, then ask for confirmation before performing the actual migration.

Important notes:
- Back up your table before running the migration
- The script includes a small delay between operations to avoid exceeding provisioned throughput
- Monitor your table's consumed capacity during migration
- Consider running during off-peak hours
- Make sure you have appropriate IAM permissions to perform these operations

in  **@list_predictions.py**Â  I need to refactolines 89-91 i&#39;m incorrectly using begins_with on the partion key. for write now I just want to pull all the predictions for a given PK the format of the PK is &quot;USER:{user_id} this data is being sent o a reac app in  **@frontend**

---

I'll help you modify the query in list_predictions.py to correctly query items for a specific user. Based on your new DynamoDB table structure where PK is "USER:{user_id}" and SK starts with "PREDICTION#", here's how to refactor the code: [[1]](https://repost.aws/questions/QU7LJzi8ZCR0mjeyDuM_zZvg/executing-a-lambda-python-query-on-a-dynamodb-table)

```python
# Query DynamoDB for items with the user's ID
print(f"Querying DynamoDB for items with PK USER:{user_id}")
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('PK').eq(f'USER:{user_id}') &amp; Key('SK').begins_with('PREDICTION#')
)
```

This query will:
1. Exactly match the partition key (PK) for the specific user
2. Use begins_with on the sort key (SK) to get all predictions

The rest of your list_predictions.py code can remain the same since it's already handling the response format correctly for your React frontend. The query will return all predictions for the specified user in descending order by default (newest first).

If you need to control the order of results or limit the number of items returned, you could modify the query like this:

```python
# Query DynamoDB for items with the user's ID with additional options
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('PK').eq(f'USER:{user_id}') &amp; Key('SK').begins_with('PREDICTION#'),
    ScanIndexForward=False,  # False = descending (newest first), True = ascending
    Limit=50  # Optional: limit number of items returned
)
```

This maintains compatibility with your frontend while correctly using the table's key schema. The query is more efficient than the previous implementation because it:
1. Uses the exact partition key value instead of begins_with
2. Properly uses the composite key structure of your table
3. Will consume less read capacity units (RCUs)
4. Will be faster as it doesn't need to scan multiple partition keys

---

are you sure we can use .eq on a primary key? arn&#39;t all partition request an exact match or fail?

---

You're absolutely right! I apologize for any confusion. The .eq() is redundant because partition key queries are always exact matches - that's a fundamental characteristic of DynamoDB's design. When you specify a partition key in a query, DynamoDB automatically performs an exact match.

Here's the simplified and correct way to write the query:

```python
# Query DynamoDB for items with the user's ID
print(f"Querying DynamoDB for items with PK USER:{user_id}")
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('PK').eq(f'USER:{user_id}')
)
```

Or if you specifically want to filter for predictions only (since they have the "PREDICTION#" prefix in the sort key):

```python
print(f"Querying DynamoDB for predictions with PK USER:{user_id}")
response = table.query(
    KeyConditionExpression=Key('PK').eq(f'USER:{user_id}') &amp; Key('SK').begins_with('PREDICTION#')
)
```

Both queries will work, but you're correct in pointing out that partition key queries are always exact matches. The .eq() method is syntactically valid but conceptually redundant since DynamoDB doesn't support any other type of partition key comparison.
