now that we have set up are cognito authorizer. i want make the LogCall lambda handler from  **@template.yaml**Â  to use the gonito authorizer which will then write our prediction json to the ddb table

when users login they loose thier current prediction data. I want the user&#39;s prediction data saved locally (I think local storage, but you can recommend otherwise) so that when they are retunerd to the page after signing up or signing in the prediction is displayed as it was when the page redirected to cogniot and the Log call button should be enabled because the user is logged in and has a prediction and finally the prediciton should be sent to the Logprediction endpoint if the user clicks the Log call button
