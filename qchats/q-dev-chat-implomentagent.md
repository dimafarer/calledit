I want to do some research I want to use a relativly new model in amazon bedrock. its so new you might not be familiaure with it, so lets start with that. Are you familure with the new awmazon model called nova?

---

Yes, I'm familiar with Amazon Nova, which was recently announced as a new generation of foundation models available through Amazon Bedrock. Amazon Nova includes several different models designed for different purposes: [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/aws-reinvent-2024-highlights-top-takeaways-from-swami-sivasubramanian-to-help-customers-manage-generative-ai-at-scale/)

1. Understanding Models:
- Amazon Nova Micro: A text-only model focused on low latency and cost [[2]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-nova-foundation-models-bedrock/)
- Amazon Nova Lite: A multimodal model that handles image, video, and text at low cost
- Amazon Nova Pro: A highly capable multimodal model balancing accuracy, speed, and cost

2. Creative Generation Models:
- Amazon Nova Canvas: For generating professional-grade images [[3]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-frontier-intelligence-and-industry-leading-price-performance/)
- Amazon Nova Reel: For video generation

Looking at your code, I notice you're currently using the Titan model (`amazon.titan-text-express-v1`). If you're interested in switching to Nova, you'll need to choose which Nova model best fits your use case. Each model has different strengths and capabilities.

Would you like to know more about a specific Nova model or would you like help implementing one of them in your code?

ok I need a very good model. its task is to help me make a prediction and then help me decide how to judge if the prediction comes true or not, including a date to make the judegement. The the model with place the prediction and the cirtiria to judge it into a json object and then post that to dunamodb.  For example if I say it will rain next tuesday the model will take the prediction and sugest to check the national weather service on next tuesday to judge the prediction.   \n\n Question: which nova model (with prompt endineering) would mostly likely work for this task?

---

For this specific task, I would recommend Amazon Nova Pro for several reasons:

1. Complex Reasoning: Your task requires:
   - Understanding natural language predictions
   - Creating structured judgment criteria
   - Temporal reasoning (understanding dates)
   - Generating structured JSON output
   - Suggesting verification sources

2. Why Nova Pro:
   - It's the most capable model in the Nova family
   - Better at complex structured outputs
   - Strong reasoning capabilities
   - Good at following multi-step instructions
   - Excellent at maintaining context and format consistency

Here's a suggested prompt engineering structure for Nova Pro:

```python
prompt_template = """
Task: Convert a prediction into a structured verification format.

Prediction: {user_prediction}

Please create a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "prediction": {
        "statement": "&lt;original prediction&gt;",
        "date_made": "&lt;current_date&gt;",
        "verification_date": "&lt;when to verify&gt;",
        "verification_method": {
            "source": "&lt;specific source to check&gt;",
            "criteria": "&lt;specific measurable criteria&gt;",
            "steps": ["&lt;step by step verification process&gt;"]
        }
    }
}

Requirements:
1. The verification_date must be specific and appropriate for the prediction
2. The verification_method must be objective and measurable
3. Include specific, authoritative sources
4. Break down verification steps clearly
"""
```

To implement this:

```python
import boto3
import json
from datetime import datetime

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')

def generate_prediction_verification(user_prediction):
    response = bedrock.invoke_model(
        modelId='us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0',
        body=json.dumps({
            "prompt": prompt_template.format(user_prediction=user_prediction),
            "temperature": 0.2,  # Lower temperature for more consistent structured output
            "topP": 0.9,
            "maxTokens": 1000
        })
    )
    
    # Parse and validate the response
    result = json.loads(response['body'].read())
    
    # Add to DynamoDB
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('PredictionsTable')
    
    # Add timestamp and prediction ID
    result['prediction']['id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
    result['prediction']['timestamp'] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    
    table.put_item(Item=result['prediction'])
    
    return result
```

The lower temperature (0.2) helps ensure consistent JSON formatting, while maintaining enough creativity to generate appropriate verification methods.

Would you like me to provide an example of how this would work with a specific prediction, or would you like to know more about fine-tuning the prompt for specific types of predictions?

---

Thanks, that was a super helpfull response. The next step of this project is to use Amamzon nova act agents to read the prediction and varification json and to take apropriet action to judege the prediction. Are you familare witth nova act agents? If yes would you make an changes to the your above recommended json strcuture or do you recommend keeping as is?

---

Yes, I'm familiar with Amazon Bedrock Agents (which can use Nova as their foundation model). For integration with Bedrock Agents, we should modify the JSON structure slightly to make it more agent-friendly and actionable. Here's the recommended modified structure: [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/agents-use-nova.html)

```python
prompt_template = """
Task: Convert a prediction into a structured verification format.

Prediction: {user_prediction}

Please create a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "prediction": {
        "id": "&lt;uuid&gt;",
        "statement": "&lt;original prediction&gt;",
        "date_made": "&lt;current_date&gt;",
        "status": "pending",
        "verification": {
            "due_date": "&lt;when to verify&gt;",
            "method": {
                "source": "&lt;specific source to check&gt;",
                "source_type": "&lt;api|web|human_check&gt;",
                "endpoint": "&lt;api_endpoint or url if applicable&gt;",
                "criteria": {
                    "success_condition": "&lt;specific measurable criteria&gt;",
                    "failure_condition": "&lt;specific measurable criteria&gt;",
                    "uncertain_condition": "&lt;criteria for unclear results&gt;"
                },
                "verification_steps": ["&lt;step by step verification process&gt;"]
            }
        },
        "result": {
            "verified_at": null,
            "outcome": null,
            "evidence": null
        }
    }
}

Requirements:
1. The verification_date must be specific and appropriate for the prediction
2. Include source_type to help the agent determine how to verify
3. Break down success/failure criteria explicitly
4. Include specific, actionable endpoints where applicable
"""
```

Key changes made to support Bedrock Agents:

1. Added `status` field for tracking
2. Added `source_type` to help agents determine verification method
3. Structured `criteria` into explicit success/failure conditions
4. Added `endpoint` for API-based verifications
5. Added `result` section for the agent to fill in
6. Separated verification method from results

The implementation would be similar:

```python
import boto3
import json
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

def generate_prediction_verification(user_prediction):
    bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
    
    response = bedrock.invoke_model(
        modelId='us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0',
        body=json.dumps({
            "prompt": prompt_template.format(user_prediction=user_prediction),
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "topP": 0.9,
            "maxTokens": 1000
        })
    )
    
    # Parse and validate the response
    result = json.loads(response['body'].read())
    
    # Add to DynamoDB
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('PredictionsTable')
    
    # Add timestamp and prediction ID if not already present
    prediction = result['prediction']
    prediction['id'] = prediction.get('id', str(uuid.uuid4()))
    prediction['date_made'] = prediction.get('date_made', datetime.utcnow().isoformat())
    prediction['status'] = prediction.get('status', 'pending')
    
    table.put_item(Item=prediction)
    
    return result
```

This structure provides several advantages for Bedrock Agents:

1. Clear action paths based on source_type
2. Explicit success/failure criteria for automated judgment
3. Structured fields for storing verification results
4. Status tracking for workflow management
5. Separate sections for prediction, verification method, and results

The agent can now:
- Automatically determine how to verify (API call, web scraping, human check)
- Have clear criteria for making judgments
- Store evidence and results in a structured way
- Track the status of verifications
- Handle different types of predictions consistently

Would you like me to provide an example of how a Bedrock Agent would interact with this structure, or would you like to know more about specific verification methods we could add?

---

yes please provide an example of how a Bedrock Agent would interact with this structure

---

I'll demonstrate how a Bedrock Agent would interact with this structure using a weather prediction example. Here's how we can set it up: [[1]](https://repost.aws/questions/QUgBSR-m5LQwy6dB912xYVeg/bedrock-agent-with-real-time-data)

```python
# First, define the agent's action group schema
weather_verification_schema = {
    "openapi": "3.0.0",
    "info": {"title": "Prediction Verification", "version": "1.0.0"},
    "paths": {
        "/verify-weather": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "verifyWeatherPrediction",
                "parameters": [
                    {
                        "name": "prediction_id",
                        "in": "query",
                        "required": true,
                        "schema": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

# Lambda function that the agent will call to verify weather predictions
def verify_weather_prediction(prediction_id):
    # Get prediction from DynamoDB
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('PredictionsTable')
    
    prediction = table.get_item(
        Key={'id': prediction_id}
    )['Item']
    
    if prediction['verification']['method']['source_type'] == 'api':
        # Make API call to weather service
        weather_data = requests.get(
            prediction['verification']['method']['endpoint'],
            params={'date': prediction['verification']['due_date']}
        ).json()
        
        # Compare against success criteria
        actual_condition = weather_data['condition']
        if actual_condition == prediction['verification']['method']['criteria']['success_condition']:
            outcome = 'success'
        elif actual_condition == prediction['verification']['method']['criteria']['failure_condition']:
            outcome = 'failure'
        else:
            outcome = 'uncertain'
            
        # Update prediction result
        table.update_item(
            Key={'id': prediction_id},
            UpdateExpression="SET #result = :r, #status = :s",
            ExpressionAttributeNames={
                '#result': 'result',
                '#status': 'status'
            },
            ExpressionAttributeValues={
                ':r': {
                    'verified_at': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                    'outcome': outcome,
                    'evidence': weather_data
                },
                ':s': 'verified'
            }
        )
```

Here's an example interaction:

1. User makes a prediction:
```python
prediction = "It will rain next Tuesday in Seattle"

# This uses our earlier code to generate the structured prediction
result = generate_prediction_verification(prediction)

# The generated JSON might look like:
{
    "prediction": {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "statement": "It will rain next Tuesday in Seattle",
        "date_made": "2024-01-24T10:00:00Z",
        "status": "pending",
        "verification": {
            "due_date": "2024-01-30T12:00:00Z",
            "method": {
                "source": "National Weather Service API",
                "source_type": "api",
                "endpoint": "https://api.weather.gov/points/47.6062,-122.3321/forecast",
                "criteria": {
                    "success_condition": "rain",
                    "failure_condition": "clear",
                    "uncertain_condition": "cloudy"
                },
                "verification_steps": [
                    "Query NWS API for Seattle forecast on 2024-01-30",
                    "Check weather condition at 12:00 PM local time",
                    "Compare actual condition against criteria"
                ]
            }
        },
        "result": {
            "verified_at": null,
            "outcome": null,
            "evidence": null
        }
    }
}
```

2. Agent Instruction Example:
```yaml
instructions: |
    You are a prediction verification agent. Your task is to:
    1. Monitor predictions in DynamoDB
    2. When a prediction's verification due_date arrives:
        - Check the source_type
        - Follow verification_steps
        - Update the result based on criteria
    3. Handle different source_types appropriately:
        - 'api': Make direct API calls
        - 'web': Extract data from websites
        - 'human_check': Create a human task
```

3. Agent Execution:
```python
# When the agent runs (triggered by EventBridge on schedule)
def agent_handler(event, context):
    # Find predictions due for verification
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('PredictionsTable')
    
    now = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    response = table.scan(
        FilterExpression='verification.due_date &lt;= :now AND #status = :pending',
        ExpressionAttributeNames={'#status': 'status'},
        ExpressionAttributeValues={':now': now, ':pending': 'pending'}
    )
    
    for prediction in response['Items']:
        if prediction['verification']['method']['source_type'] == 'api':
            # Call the verification Lambda
            lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
            lambda_client.invoke(
                FunctionName='verify_weather_prediction',
                InvocationType='Event',
                Payload=json.dumps({'prediction_id': prediction['id']})
            )
```

4. Final Result Example:
```json
{
    "prediction": {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "status": "verified",
        "result": {
            "verified_at": "2024-01-30T12:00:00Z",
            "outcome": "success",
            "evidence": {
                "location": "Seattle, WA",
                "timestamp": "2024-01-30T12:00:00Z",
                "condition": "rain",
                "temperature": 52,
                "precipitation_probability": 90
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The agent can handle different types of verifications based on the source_type:
- `api`: Makes direct API calls (like weather APIs)
- `web`: Could use web scraping for sources without APIs
- `human_check`: Could create tasks in systems like Amazon Mechanical Turk

This structure allows the agent to:
1. Understand how to verify each prediction
2. Follow specific steps for verification
3. Make clear judgments based on criteria
4. Store evidence and results
5. Update the prediction status

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this interaction or explain how to handle different types of predictions?
