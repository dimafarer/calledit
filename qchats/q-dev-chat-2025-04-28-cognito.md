I'll share updates here as I work on this.

**Summary of changes**
1. I'll help you resolve the import error for "aws-amplify". First, I'll explore the repository structure to understand the codebase better.
2. Now I'll check the package.json file to see if aws-amplify is listed as a dependency, as the error suggests it's missing.
3. I'll now look at the amplifyConfig.ts file that's causing the error to understand how it's using aws-amplify.
4.  Interesting. The file content doesn't match the error message. Let me check if there are any other versions of this file or if it was recently modified:
5. The error message shows code that doesn't match the actual file. Let me check if there are any other references to aws-amplify in the codebase.
6. Let me check where the amplifyConfig.ts file is being imported to understand its usage in the application.
7. Let me check the main.tsx file to see if it's importing the amplifyConfig.ts file, as that's often where configuration is initialized.
8. Now I'll check the authService.ts file to understand the authentication implementation and its relationship with Amplify.
9. Let me check the AuthContext.tsx file to see if it's using aws-amplify for authentication.
10. Let me check the index.css file to understand the structure of the frontend application better.
11. Let me check the App.tsx file to understand the main application structure.
12. Based on my investigation, I need to install the aws-amplify package since it's being imported but not listed in the dependencies.
13. I am now running `cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r ../requirements.txt cd frontend && npm install aws-amplify` command.
14. Now I need to update the amplifyConfig.ts file to properly use the aws-amplify package.
15. Now I need to update the authService.ts file to use the aws-amplify package for authentication.

21. Let's run the tests to see if our changes have fixed the issue.
22. I am now running `echo 'No test commands configured in package.json or backend'` command.
23.  Let's try to build the project to see if our changes have fixed the issue:
24. I am now running `cd frontend && npm run build` command.
25. We need to add type declarations for aws-amplify. Let's install the @types/aws-amplify package.
26. I am now running `cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r ../requirements.txt cd frontend && npm install @aws-amplify/auth` command.
27.  Let's try installing the aws-amplify package with the correct types:

I'll share updates here as I work on this.

**Summary of changes**
1. I'll help you resolve the import error for "aws-amplify". First, I'll explore the repository structure to understand the codebase better.
2. Now I'll check the package.json file to see if aws-amplify is listed as a dependency, as the error suggests it's missing.
3. I'll now look at the amplifyConfig.ts file that's causing the error to understand how it's using aws-amplify.
4.  Interesting. The file content doesn't match the error message. Let me check if there are any other versions of this file or if it was recently modified:
5. The error message shows code that doesn't match the actual file. Let me check if there are any other references to aws-amplify in the codebase.
6. Let me check where the amplifyConfig.ts file is being imported to understand its usage in the application.
7. Let me check the main.tsx file to see if it's importing the amplifyConfig.ts file, as that's often where configuration is initialized.

now lets set up the backend of the login button. cognito user pool with the attention of letting the cognoto hosted UI do as much of the work as possible. I also need to save the cognito token locally so we can use it with our apigateway authorizer requests. (currntly non of our lambda use an authoizer but we will change that after we get cognito set up. You can asee the cognito set up in my SAM template template.yaml

**Summary of changes**
1. I'll help you resolve the import error for "aws-amplify". First, I'll explore the repository structure to understand the codebase better.
2. Now I'll check the package.json file to see if aws-amplify is listed as a dependency, as the error suggests it's missing.
3. I'll now look at the amplifyConfig.ts file that's causing the error to understand how it's using aws-amplify.
4.  Interesting. The file content doesn't match the error message. Let me check if there are any other versions of this file or if it was recently modified:
5. The error message shows code that doesn't match the actual file. Let me check if there are any other references to aws-amplify in the codebase.
6. Let me check where the amplifyConfig.ts file is being imported to understand its usage in the application.
7. Let me check the main.tsx file to see if it's importing the amplifyConfig.ts file, as that's often where configuration is initialized.
8. Now I'll check the authService.ts file to understand the authentication implementation and its relationship with Amplify.
9. Let me check the AuthContext.tsx file to see if it's using aws-amplify for authentication.
10. Let me check the index.css file to understand the structure of the frontend application better.
11. Let me check the App.tsx file to understand the main application structure.
12. Based on my investigation, I need to install the aws-amplify package since it's being imported but not listed in the dependencies.
13. I am now running `cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r ../requirements.txt cd frontend && npm install aws-amplify` command.
14. Now I need to update the amplifyConfig.ts file to properly use the aws-amplify package.
15. Now I need to update the authService.ts file to use the aws-amplify package for authentication.
16. Now I need to update the AuthContext.tsx file to handle the async nature of the updated authService functions.
17. Now I need to update the tests to handle the changes we've made to the authentication system.
18.  
19. I need to update the test files to handle the async nature of the updated authentication functions.
20.  Now let's update the authService.test.ts file:
21. Let's run the tests to see if our changes have fixed the issue.
22. I am now running `echo 'No test commands configured in package.json or backend'` command.
23.  Let's try to build the project to see if our changes have fixed the issue:
24. I am now running `cd frontend && npm run build` command.
25. We need to add type declarations for aws-amplify. Let's install the @types/aws-amplify package.
26. I am now running `cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r ../requirements.txt cd frontend && npm install @aws-amplify/auth` command.
27.  Let's try installing the aws-amplify package with the correct types:
28. I am now running `cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r ../requirements.txt cd frontend && npm install @aws-amplify/auth @aws-amplify/core` command.
29. Let's update our code to use the correct imports for aws-amplify.
30.  Now let's update the authService.ts file:
31.  Now let's update the authService.test.ts file:
32. Let's build the project again to see if our changes have fixed the issue.
33. I am now running `cd frontend && npm run build` command.
34. Great! The build is now successful. Let's summarize the changes we made to fix the issue.
