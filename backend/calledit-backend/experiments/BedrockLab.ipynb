You will see a set of empty square brackets [ ] to the left of each code cell. When the code is running, an asterisk will appear inside the square brackets [*]. When the code completes, the square brackets will contain a number, and any results will be displayed beneath the code cell. This number will increase with each cell you run. You can use this to see the order the cells were run in. The data cells in this notebook must be run in order, but you can run a cell multiple times. Make sure to run the cells in order from top to bottom to avoid errors. This allows you to step through the analysis one cell at a time."

    "In the following tasks, you will use the Amazon Bedrock Runtime service to generate text and images using the Amazon Titan Text Express and Titan Image Generator models. You will invoke these models with specific prompts and configurations. You will process the generated content, which can be text or base64-encoded images. Additionally, you will perform tasks such as uploading the generated images to an Amazon S3 bucket, retrieving them from the bucket, and displaying them using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). This functionality is valuable for validating the quality and capabilities of models. It can also enable further processing or decision-making based on the generated content."

    "In this code block, you won't update three pre-populated functions (`upload_images_to_s3`, `display_images_from_s3`, and `perform_s3_operations`). The goal here is to create a function for creating an S3 bucket.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_s3_bucket` function you will create is a utility function that simplifies the process of creating an Amazon S3 bucket in a specified AWS Region using the boto3 library. It will handle the creation of the Amazon S3 client, the bucket creation request, and error handling. The function should call a bucket name with a Region (provided in the lab instructions guide) to create a new S3 bucket in the desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define the function:** This function should take two parameters: `bucket_name` (a string representing the name of the S3 bucket to be created) and `region` (an optional string representing the AWS Region where the bucket should be created, with a default value of the Region your lab instruction guide shows).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create an Amazon S3 client:** Inside the function, you must create a client for the Amazon S3 service using the boto3 library. This client will be used to interact with the Amazon S3 service and create the bucket. Use the `boto3.client` method, passing `'s3'` as the service name and the `region_name` parameter with the value of the Region argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement error handling:** Since the bucket creation process might encounter errors, it's essential to implement error handling using a `try-except` block. Wrap the code that creates the bucket inside the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configure bucket location:** Before creating the bucket, you must configure the location where the bucket should be created. This is necessary for Regions other than the default us-east-1 Region. Create a dictionary object with a key-value pair, where the key is `'LocationConstraint'` and the value is the `region` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create the bucket:** Use the Amazon S3 client object to create the bucket. The client object should have a method (for example, `create_bucket`) that allows you to create a new bucket. Pass the `bucket_name` argument as a parameter to this method, along with any additional parameters required for bucket creation, such as the location configuration you created in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle success case:** If the bucket creation is successful, you can print a success message to the console. Use an f-string or another string formatting method to include the bucket_name and Region values in the success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle error case:** In the except block, catch the appropriate exception that the boto3 library raises when there is an error creating the bucket. This exception is likely to be the ClientError exception. Print an error message to the console, including the `bucket_name`, `region`, and the error details from the caught exception object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Replace the `FMI-UNIQUE-BUCKET-NAME` for the bucket_name variable at the end of the code block with a unique S3 bucket name, and replace the four `ENTER REGION HERE` placeholders with your current Region."
