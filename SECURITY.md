# Security Policy

## Overview

CalledIt is a serverless prediction verification platform built with security-first principles. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and deployment security considerations.

## üîí Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **AWS Cognito** for user authentication and session management
- **JWT tokens** for API authorization with automatic expiration
- **IAM roles** with least-privilege access principles
- **API Gateway authorizers** for endpoint protection
- **CORS policies** with explicit origin validation

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest** via DynamoDB default encryption + KMS
- **Encryption in transit** via HTTPS/WSS for all communications
- **S3 KMS encryption** for verification logs with object lock
- **SNS KMS encryption** for notification security
- **No sensitive data** stored in client-side code
- **Environment variable isolation** for configuration secrets
- **TTL enabled** on DynamoDB for automatic data cleanup

### Infrastructure Security
- **Serverless architecture** reduces attack surface
- **AWS Lambda** with isolated execution environments
- **VPC isolation** available for enhanced network security
- **CloudFormation** for infrastructure as code with security controls
- **Object Lock** enabled on S3 buckets for compliance

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

### Code Security
- ‚úÖ **No hardcoded credentials** in source code
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** on all API endpoints
- ‚úÖ **CORS policies** properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Content Security Policy** headers implemented

### Dependency Management
- ‚úÖ **Regular dependency updates** via automated scanning
- ‚úÖ **Vulnerability scanning** of npm and pip packages
- ‚úÖ **Minimal dependency footprint** to reduce attack surface
- ‚úÖ **Pinned versions** for reproducible builds

### Deployment Security
- ‚úÖ **Separate environments** (dev/staging/prod) with isolated credentials
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure as Code** with version control
- ‚úÖ **Automated security testing** in CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Zero-downtime deployments** with rollback capabilities

## üîê Secrets Management

### üö® Public Repository Security
**CRITICAL**: This code is hosted on public GitHub - extra security measures implemented:

- **Zero hardcoded secrets** - all sensitive data via environment variables
- **Example files only** - `.env.example` provided, never actual credentials
- **Gitignore protection** - all sensitive files explicitly ignored
- **Pre-commit hooks** - scan for accidental credential commits
- **Branch protection** - require reviews for all changes

### Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables:

```bash
# Frontend (.env - never committed, in .gitignore)
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-pool-id
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com

# Backend (AWS Lambda environment variables - managed by CloudFormation)
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=${CognitoUserPool}
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=${DynamoDBTable}
```

### AWS Credentials
- **IAM roles** used for Lambda execution (no access keys in code)
- **Temporary credentials** via AWS STS for cross-service access
- **Least privilege** permissions for all AWS resources
- **Regular credential rotation** following AWS best practices
- **CloudFormation parameters** for sensitive infrastructure values

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: [Your security contact email]
3. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, potential impact
4. **Response**: We will acknowledge within 48 hours and provide updates

### Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.5.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 1.4.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 1.3.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security fixes only |
| < 1.3   | ‚ùå No              |

### Security Updates

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patched within 24-48 hours
- **High severity**: Patched within 1 week
- **Medium/Low severity**: Included in next regular release

## üî¥ Critical Security Fixes (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ Recently Addressed
- **CWE-117 Log Injection**: Sanitized all user input before logging
- **CWE-79 XSS Prevention**: Enhanced input validation in auth flows
- **Infrastructure Hardening**: Added KMS encryption to S3 and SNS
- **Data Lifecycle**: Implemented TTL on DynamoDB tables
- **Credential Exposure**: Removed sensitive data from CloudWatch logs
- **CORS Security**: Fixed fallback origin validation

### üö® High Priority Remaining
- **Environment Validation**: Add startup validation for required ENV vars
- **Performance Optimization**: Move DynamoDB initialization outside handlers
- **Error Handling**: Improve exception handling in auth context

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing) via Amazon CodeGuru
- **Dependency scanning** via GitHub Dependabot
- **Infrastructure scanning** via AWS Config and Security Hub
- **Real-time monitoring** via AWS GuardDuty

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing** performed quarterly
- **Code reviews** with security focus for all changes
- **Security architecture reviews** for major features
- **Vulnerability assessments** using Amazon Inspector

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation implemented for user data
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerability-free
