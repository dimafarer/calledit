docs: organize documentation into proper folder structure

Moved all loose .md files from root directory into organized docs structure
to improve maintainability and discoverability.

Changes:
- Created docs/guides/ for operational guides and how-tos
- Moved handler cleanup docs to docs/guides/
- Moved phase completion reports to docs/historical/
- Reformatted and improved LOCAL_DEBUG_SETUP.md
- Deleted obsolete files (loggingcalls.md, temporary guides)
- Updated README.md with new documentation paths

New Structure:
docs/
├── guides/                    (NEW)
│   ├── HANDLER_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md
│   ├── HANDLER_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md
│   ├── LOCAL_DEBUG_SETUP.md
│   └── STRANDS_BEST_PRACTICES_REVIEW.md
└── historical/                (UPDATED)
    ├── PHASE1_COMPLETE.md
    ├── PHASE2_COMPLETE.md
    └── MCP_RENAME_PLAN.md

Benefits:
- Cleaner root directory (removed 9 .md files)
- Better organization following existing docs/ pattern
- Easier to find relevant documentation
- Consistent with project structure

Files Moved: 9
Files Deleted: 4 (obsolete/temporary)
Files Created: 4 (organized versions)
