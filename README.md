# Data Visualization Demos

This repository contains demonstrations of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Files

1. **pandas_basics.py**: Demonstrates fundamental pandas operations
   - Series and DataFrame creation
   - Data manipulation (insert, drop, rename)
   - Data combination (concat, merge)
   - Statistical analysis (crosstab, correlation)

2. **matplotlib_basics.py**: Demonstrates basic matplotlib visualizations
   - Line plots
   - Scatter plots
   - Bar plots
   - Histograms
   - Pair plots

3. **seaborn_basics.py**: Demonstrates enhanced visualizations with seaborn
   - Enhanced line plots
   - Scatter plots with regression lines
   - Enhanced categorical bar plots
   - Distribution plots
   - Correlation heatmaps

4. **integrated_demo.py**: Demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow
   - Data generation and cleaning
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Advanced visualizations
   - Customer segmentation analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Demos

Run each demo script individually:

```bash
python pandas_basics.py
python matplotlib_basics.py
python seaborn_basics.py
python integrated_demo.py
```

## Output

- All visualizations are saved to the `plots` directory
- Data files from the integrated demo are saved to the `data` directory

## Learning Path

For beginners, it's recommended to go through the demos in this order:

1. Start with `pandas_basics.py` to learn data manipulation
2. Move to `matplotlib_basics.py` to learn basic plotting
3. Continue with `seaborn_basics.py` to learn enhanced visualizations
4. Finish with `integrated_demo.py` to see everything working together

## Key Concepts Covered

- Data structures (Series, DataFrame)
- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Basic statistical analysis
- Various plot types and customizations
- Enhanced visualizations with seaborn
- Complete data analysis workflow
