chore: Clean up unused Lambda handlers

Removed 5 deprecated Lambda handlers and their tests to streamline
codebase before Strands refactoring. All handlers were superseded by
newer implementations or were demo/test functions.

Deleted:
- handlers/hello_world/ (demo function)
- handlers/make_call/ (replaced by strands_make_call streaming)
- handlers/prompt_bedrock/ (superseded by Strands agents)
- handlers/prompt_agent/ (superseded by Strands agents)
- handlers/shared/ (unused utilities)
- tests/hello_world/
- tests/make_call/

Modified:
- template.yaml: Removed 5 function definitions and outputs

Result: 38% reduction in Lambda functions (13 → 8)

Verified: Deployment successful, no behavioral changes detected
