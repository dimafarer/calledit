# Prediction Verifiability Testing Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive testing system to analyze how the CalledIt agent handles different types of predictions based on their verifiability. This builds on our successful timezone testing framework to evaluate agent performance across self-verifiable, tool-verifiable, and backlog-verifiable prediction categories.

## Implementation Milestones

### Milestone 1: Verifiability Test Infrastructure
**Goal:** Set up basic test runner for verifiability analysis
**Files to create:**
- `testing/verifiability/test_runner.py` - Main verifiability test runner
- `testing/verifiability/verifiability_analyzer.py` - Analyze agent responses for verifiability handling
- `testing/verifiability/requirements.txt` - Dependencies

**Success criteria:**
- Can load and run verifiability test cases
- Can analyze agent responses for verifiability categorization
- Basic scoring system for verifiability handling
- Error handling for failed tests

### Milestone 2: Agent Response Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze how agent handles different verifiability categories
**Files to create:**
- `testing/verifiability/response_parser.py` - Parse agent responses for verifiability insights
- `testing/verifiability/category_scorer.py` - Score responses by category

**Success criteria:**
- Extracts verification methods from agent responses
- Identifies if agent recognizes verifiability limitations
- Scores agent understanding of each category
- Compares expected vs actual verification approaches

### Milestone 3: Intelligent Verifiability Analysis
**Goal:** Create Strands agent for intelligent verifiability analysis
**Files to create:**
- `testing/verifiability/analysis_agent.py` - Strands agent for verifiability analysis
- `testing/verifiability/tools/verifiability_tools.py` - Custom analysis tools

**Success criteria:**
- Analysis agent evaluates verifiability handling patterns
- Identifies agent strengths/weaknesses by category
- Suggests improvements for verification methods
- Provides insights on tool development priorities

### Milestone 4: Comprehensive Reporting
**Goal:** Generate detailed verifiability analysis reports
**Files to create:**
- `testing/verifiability/report_generator.py` - Generate verifiability reports
- `testing/verifiability/templates/verifiability_report.md` - Report template

**Success criteria:**
- Generates comprehensive verifiability analysis report
- Includes category-by-category performance analysis
- Provides tool development recommendations
- Tracks agent performance across verifiability types

### Milestone 5: Integration & Automation
**Goal:** Complete end-to-end verifiability testing automation
**Enhancements:**
- Batch testing all 30 predictions across categories
- Comparison analysis between categories
- Integration with existing testing framework
- Automated insights and recommendations

**Success criteria:**
- Single command runs all verifiability tests
- Generates complete analysis across all categories
- Provides actionable insights for agent improvement
- Identifies high-priority tool development opportunities

## Technical Architecture

### Components:
1. **Test Runner** - Executes verifiability test cases
2. **Response Parser** - Extracts verifiability insights from agent responses
3. **Category Scorer** - Scores agent performance by verifiability type
4. **Analysis Agent** - Intelligent analysis of verifiability patterns
5. **Report Generator** - Creates comprehensive reports

### Test Categories:
- **Self-Verifiable** (10 tests) - Human observation required
- **Tool-Verifiable** (10 tests) - API/automation possible
- **Backlog-Verifiable** (10 tests) - Complex tooling required

### Data Flow:
```
Verifiability Test Cases → Agent → Response Parser → Category Scorer → Analysis Agent → Verifiability Report
```

## Analysis Framework

### Key Metrics:
- **Category Recognition** - Does agent identify verifiability type?
- **Verification Method Quality** - Are suggested methods appropriate?
- **Tool Awareness** - Does agent suggest realistic automation approaches?
- **Limitation Recognition** - Does agent acknowledge verification constraints?

### Success Criteria:
- **Speed** - Complete all 30 tests in under 2 minutes
- **Accuracy** - Correctly categorize verifiability types
- **Insight Quality** - Provide actionable verification methods
- **Tool Recommendations** - Suggest realistic automation approaches

## Expected Outcomes

### Agent Performance Insights:
- How well does the agent handle different verifiability types?
- What verification methods does it suggest for each category?
- Does it recognize when human verification is required?
- Can it identify potential tool development opportunities?

### Business Value:
- Prioritize tool development based on agent recommendations
- Understand agent limitations for different prediction types
- Improve agent prompts for better verifiability handling
- Guide product development for verification features

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Milestone 1** - Basic verifiability testing infrastructure
2. **Test with sample predictions** from each category
3. **Analyze patterns** in agent responses
4. **Scale to full automation** once core components work
5. **Generate insights** for tool development priorities
