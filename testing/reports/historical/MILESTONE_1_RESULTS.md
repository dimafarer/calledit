# Milestone 1: Verifiability Test Infrastructure - COMPLETE ✅

## Results Summary

### 📊 **Performance by Category:**
- **Tool-Verifiable:** 80% (excellent API/data handling)
- **Backlog-Verifiable:** 73% (good complex scenario handling)  
- **Self-Verifiable:** 50% (needs improvement on human verification recognition)
- **Overall Score:** 67.8% across all categories

### ✅ **Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Can load and run verifiability test cases (9/9 tests successful)
- ✅ Can analyze agent responses for verifiability categorization
- ✅ Basic scoring system for verifiability handling (4-metric scoring)
- ✅ Error handling for failed tests

### 📁 **Files Created:**
- `testing/verifiability/test_runner.py` - Main verifiability test runner
- `testing/verifiability/verifiability_analyzer.py` - Analyze agent responses for verifiability handling
- `testing/verifiability/requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### 🔍 **Key Insights:**
- Agent **excels at suggesting data sources** and APIs for tool-verifiable predictions
- **Strong verification method quality** across all categories (100% average)
- **Weaker at recognizing human verification limitations** for self-verifiable predictions
- **Good category recognition** for tool and backlog predictions

### 🎯 **Next Steps:**
Ready for **Milestone 2: Agent Response Analysis** to improve scoring accuracy and dive deeper into response patterns.
